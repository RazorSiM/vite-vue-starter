# Vite Vue3 Starter

My Vite starter template for fast prototyping

## Packages

- Tailwind CSS
- Tailwind JIT for faster development
- Vue Router because eventually you'll need it
- Vueuse because it's super usefull

## Code Style and Linters

I tried to configure everything to work with:

- Eslint for linting errors in JS/Vue
- Stylelint for Css
- Prettier for code formatting and code styling
- Lint Staged and Husky for pre-commit hooks.

## How to run it

First of all, install the dependencies:
`npm install` or `yarn`
Run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start hacking.

In your `./package.json` Script section there are some useful commands configured, so check it out.

TODO:

- [x] Add Stylelint
- [ ] Add Vuex or Pinia as store manager
